# Project1

The name will be changed when I actually come up with one. 

This is a project to mostly keep up on my Java skills as I am not taking a full semester long course. 

My hope is to create a small program that syncs with e-mail, RSS feed, and others to make notification avatar that can move around your desktop and generally look cute and stuff! Will update as I go, if I go - balancing with school stuff will probably be tough.
